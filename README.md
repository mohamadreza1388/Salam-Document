## Serving

If you are a Python lover, you can run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000`. Otherwise, powered by JavaScript, you can run `npm i docsify-cli -g` once and finally run `docsify init .` to serve. Or, if you're using Nginx as a web server, enjoy using the provided `.nginx` config template to make it easy and work smoothly.
